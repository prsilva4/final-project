Data Analytics Final Project

This is the Final Project of the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp. 
The goal was to develop a product that would help idendify which tweets are related to disasters. This was done through data gathering, data cleaning and model fitting.

Overview

The project was divided in:

Database Analysis
Choosing a ML model
Data Clean Up
Model Fitting and Accuracy testing
Creating a function that would allow inddividual tweet input
Flask Deployment


Problem Setting

With the development of digital technologies there is a need for machine learning models to idetify the type of data users are posting online to ensure that community guidelines are being followed. Social media platforms need to be able to identify if a post is a standard random post from a user, or if it is fake news, terrorism related posted or any other type that should prompt an alert.

In this project I am focusing on trying ti identify disaster related tweets.

Data Collection

The data collection was done through a Kaggle data set that had abouth 10 thousands tweets that were labelled as being a disaster or not.
